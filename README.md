Simple, fast counter-based random number generators based on
experimentally-derived function approximations of random permutations
and "generator stacking" of generators with co-prime periods.

Both generators pass PractRand. lwrand32 passes BigCrush. I'll update for lwrand64 when I can test it correctly.
